### Behaviour in groups:

* If this bot is added to a group, it will try and behave like an actual user and reply to media sent (40% of the time by default) with some reactions.
* The bot will also check for profanity (20% of the time by default) and will suggest to stop using it.
* If any user replies to a message from the bot, it will reply to the user just like it would in private chat. The only difference is that here it does not learn from your replies.
* The bot will not reply back to your reply if you prepend or append your message with `!r`.
* The bot will reply to the user if he is mentioned (@) in the message.

### Behaviour in private chat:

* In private, the bot becomes a chatbot and tries to simulate a real life conversation.
* The bot also learns from your conversation and might use it to improve the quality of future conversations.
* If one or more emojis are present, the bot will also add that many number of random emojis to its reply.
* It still reacts to media files just like in groups.

### Inline mode:
This bot will give you clips from [Shanisirmodule](https://github.com/tmslads/Shanisirmodule) (private repo sorry!), @ the bot and type a name of a clip and click on a result to send it to the target chat as a mp3 file.
